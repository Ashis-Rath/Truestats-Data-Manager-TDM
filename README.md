# Truestats-Data-Manager-TDM
This is an Android Application exclusively developed for the Health Care Providers. This Platform would allow Hospitals, Oxygen Suppliers and Other Healthcare Providers to efficiently share their Data with the Public at once thereby eliminating the hassle of Individually attending people one at a time. This Platform i.e. TDM (Truestats Data Manager) along with Truestats would bring in Transparency of the Demand & Supply system of Healthcare Beds. This platform would also help to reduce the Unobtrusive Problem of saturated Medical Infrastructure during Peak Phases of a Pandemic.
Features of TDM:
1. Healthcare Providers can effortlessly update the Information on Available Beds, Phone Number, Map Address which would help the People in Need to reach them without any hassle
2. Healthcare Providers now won't have to guide everyone Individually
3. Precise Healthcare Data will now save more precious lives.

Example 1 [Vacant Bed Statistic Problem]: Ravi Singhal in UP’s Agra aged 47 diagnosed with COVID-19 could not be saved despite his wife’s desperate last ditch attempts to revive his breathing through mouth-to-mouth cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). His wife Renu Singhal took Ravi to at least four private hospitals before arriving at Sarojini Naidu Medical College (SNMC) and Hospital, where too she was denied admission.

Renu Singhal took her husband to five different Hospitals where there were no beds available for any new admission. If the precise number of beds available in the nearby Hospitals were known to Renu beforehand, she could have saved the precious time and taken her husband only to that Hospital or Health Care Center which was open to new admission, increasing his chances of survival. So, the possibility of saving such a precious life is always higher with an efficient communication network between the Health Care System and the Public.

 

Example 2 [Oxygen Statistic Problem]: On 16 April, 2021: Vinay Srivastava in UP’s Balrampur aged 65, A journalist died with COVID-19 symptoms after tweeting his declining oxygen levels in a desperate search for medical help. He tweeted in Hindi that his oxygen levels had dropped to 52 - far below the normal levels of 95 or above. “I am 65 years old. Plus, I have spondylitis, due to which my oxygen has reduced to 52. Nobody at the hospital lab, or the doctor is picking the phone.”

Now if the precise availability of Oxygen with its location had been known to Late Vinay Srivastava, instead of waiting for an already collapsed Health Care System to full fill the Oxygen requirement, he could have worked in the right direction to procure the Oxygen himself within his own arrangement and thereby increasing his chances of survival.
